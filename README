#  DESCRIPTION:  This is a little script I wrote when I was first learning      #
#                about Fourier series and transforms.                           #
#                                                                               #
#                It's purpose is to use the DFT in order to generate a curve    #
#                interpolates it's points in a smooth way.                      #
#                The user can enter the points to be interpolated manually or   #
#                choose from a list of examples. The program then calculates    #
#                the trigonometric polynomial using the values obtained from    #
#                the DFT. Finally, by plotting a parametric curve given by the  #
#                real and the imaginary parts of the polynomial, we can graph   #
#                the curve in 2D.                                               #
#                                                                               #
#                More information on the trigonometric interpolation polynomial #
#                can be found here:                                             #

# REQUIREMENTS:  python 2.6, numpy, sympy , matplotlib                          #
#         BUGS:  * When entering the list <C-c> does not quit the program       #
#                * Plot window not properly fit (might use matplotlib)          #
